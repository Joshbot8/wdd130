                Optimus Prime
                <div id="character1-details" class="character-details">
                    <p>Optimus Prime is the embodiment of compassion, honor and cour- age. He believes that freedom is everyone's right, and he will fight tirelessly to protect his troops and any and all innocent creatures to the extent that he would sacrifice his own life if it meant saving another.</p>

                <div id="character2-details" class="character-details">
                    <p>Jazz is one of the fastest, most nimble Autobots and is also known for keeping his cool no matter how bad the situation might seem. His known veichle mode is a Cybertronian sports car.</p>

                <div id="character3-details" class="character-details">
                    <p>Cliffjumper may not be the largest Autobot around, but he doesn't let that get in the way of picking fights with Decepticons. Fearless and brash, Cliffjumjper's favorite weapons happen to be his fists.</p>

                    <p>
                        Bumblebee is a small, energetic, and determined Autobot. He's an excellent scout and messenger because of his small size and speed. He can get into places that other bots can't, which makes him good for sabotage.

                Grimlock
                <div id="character5-details" class="character-details">
                    <p>Grimlock is the leader of the Dinobots and an Autobot. He views Optimus Prime as a weak leader, too afraid to make the tough calls and act on instinct. As such Grimlock is more than ready to disobey orders if he thinks the ends will justify the means. His one obvious redeeming feature is his attachment to his team.</p>

                    <p>Jetfire is an Autobot scientist, jet, and a Seeker, who believes that technology is the way forward, used to be originally a keeper of Dark Energon. He is a dedicated scientist whose personal upgrades to his chassis have made him the fastest Autobot on Cybertron.</p>

                <div id="character7-details" class="character-details">
                    <p>He is a towering Autobot that is covered from head to toe in heavy artillery weaponry. He is the last line of defense for the Autobots and will respond only to the commands of the last Prime. This also allows Optimus to sync with Metroplex's targeting systems and mark targets for Metroplex to destroy.</p>

                    <p>Megatron is the founder of the Decepticon uprising. He is charismatic, violent, and full of rage for anyone who would stand in the way of his ambition.

                    <p>The air commander of the Seekers, Starscream is as ambitious as they come. During the early days of the war, Starscream sold the services of the Seekers to Megatron in order to one day usurp his Decepticon master and take command of Cybertron for himself.</p>

                    <p>Onslaught believes precision and planning are the keys to success, He spends hours devising battle plans considering contingencies, and deliberating troop disposition before ever committing his forces to battle. Once the fight is joined, however, no robot is a fiercer fighter.</p>

                    <p>
                        Blast Off is a speed demon who is reckless about his speed. He may seem disgusted by those who can't reach the orbit on their own, but this is just a front to hide his loneliness.
